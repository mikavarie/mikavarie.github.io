            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>PRISTIN. Skincare </p>
            
            <p>PRISTIN. is a natural, clean skincare company powered by antioxidants and vitamins designed to revitalize and illuminate your skin. The name PRISTIN. was born from combining “prismatic”, described as “radiant and illuminating”, and “elastin”, meaning “supple and refreshed.” Utilizing nature for inspiration, our simplistic plant-based products are the recipe for radiance to keep you glowing every day.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target market is 16-30-year-olds, dominantly females who want an approachable, and clean alternative to skincare. Our audience is for those who wish for transparency on what they put on their skin and clean products. We target teens that want skincare products to reduce acne, maintain clear skin and maintain a youthful complexion as they age to delay the occurrence of wrinkles. Other products would also target mature audiences as they would find our anti-aging and hydrating treatments appealing to maintain bouncy, elastic-skin. Both demographics would be interested in natural, non-toxic ingredients they put on their skin to prevent the use of specific ingredients that cause harmful health effects such as carcinogens, endocrine disruptions, hormone disruptions, and irritations caused by parabens, synthetic fragrance, etc. </p>
           
            <p>Our approach to revolutionary formulations of antioxidant and vitamin-rich organic botanicals ensures that every drop rejuvenizes your skin, yielding better results than conventional or natural products. These skincare essentials are clean, clinically validated, cruelty-free, and free of parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, perfect for transforming your skin, leaving your skin supple and radiant. </p>

        <h3 class="process">Our Bagel Making Process</h3>
              <p>Many bagel shops have moved to what is called “steam and bake” as a way of producing more bagels in a shorter time and at a substantially lower cost. Steaming is just not the same as boiling a bagel.  Boiled bagels have a more defined and chewy crust, are smaller in size, but not weight, and because they are handled more in the process the bagel is not uniform in size and shape. This adds to the uniqueness of the bagel and allows the baker to adjust each batch depending on temperature, humidity, and density of the dough.  Every bagel is personally made to our high standards of quality.</p>

        <h3 class= "wherever">Bagel up where ever you are!</h3>
              <p>We hope you enjoy our bagels.  We have a passion for these little wonders made fresh daily for you on the central coast.  You can get our bagels at our store in San Luis Obispo and at 11 other locations in the area.  The next time you see a bagel in your favorite deli or coffee shop, ask if it is a House of Bagels Central Coast bagel.  In most cases it is one of ours, so know you will be getting the same freshly baked bagels you would get in one of our stores. In addition to bagels we also offer fresh baked goods, bagel pizzas, locally roasted coffee, specialty salads, an entire line of fruit smoothies, iced teas and coffees.</p>
